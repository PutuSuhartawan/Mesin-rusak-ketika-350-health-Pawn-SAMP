 suggestions to improve the security of your UCP and implement Google Authenticator.

Use a strong password policy: Implement password policies such as requiring a minimum password length, including uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.

Hash and Salt Passwords: Store passwords in a hashed and salted format in your database to make it harder for hackers to access passwords even if they manage to gain access to your database.

Two-factor authentication: Implement two-factor authentication (2FA) using Google Authenticator to add an extra layer of security to your UCP. Google Authenticator generates a one-time password that the user enters along with their regular password to log in.

Use HTTPS: Secure your UCP with HTTPS, which encrypts all data exchanged between the user's browser and your web server.

Prevent SQL Injection: Use prepared statements or parameterized queries in your database queries to prevent SQL injection attacks.

Regular Security Audits: Conduct regular security audits to identify vulnerabilities and fix them as soon as possible.

User Activity Logging: Implement user activity logging to monitor user activities on the UCP and detect any suspicious activities.

Limit Failed Login Attempts: Implement a login attempt limit to prevent brute force attacks.

By implementing the above suggestions, you can significantly improve the security of your UCP and prevent hacking attempts.

script using enums to store important data for secure UCP:

Copy code
enum EUserFields
{
    USERNAME,
    PASSWORD,
    EMAIL,
    PHONE_NUMBER,
    ADDRESS,
    GOOGLE_AUTH,
    LAST_LOGIN,
    LOGIN_ATTEMPTS
};

// Define a struct to hold user data
struct UserData

    string username[MAX_PLAYER_NAME];
    string password[64];
    string email[64];
    string phone_number[16];
    string address[64];
    bool google_auth;
    string last_login[32];
    int login_attempts;
};

// Define a function to retrieve user data from the database using the username
bool GetUserData(string username[], UserData &out data)
{
    // Retrieve the user data from the database using the username
    // ...
    // Set the retrieved data to the 'data' parameter
    data.username[0] = username;
    data.password[0] = "password123";
    data.email[0] = "user@example.com";
    data.phone_number[0] = "123456789";
    data.address[0] = "123 Main Street";
    data.google_auth = true;
    data.last_login[0] = "2022-03-19 10:30:00";
    data.login_attempts = 0;

    return true;
}

// Define a function to update user data in the database using the username
bool UpdateUserData(string username[], UserData data)
{
    // Update the user data in the database using the username and the data struct
    // ...
    return true;
}

// Example usage of the GetUserData and UpdateUserData functions
new username[MAX_PLAYER_NAME];
GetPlayerName(playerid, username, sizeof(username));
UserData data;
GetUserData(username, data);
// Use the retrieved data
data.google_auth = false;
UpdateUserData(username, data);
This script defines an enum EUserFields to store important user data fields like username, password, email, phone number, etc. It also defines a struct UserData to hold the user data and provides functions to retrieve and update the data in the database.

Using enums to store important data fields can make the code more readable and maintainable, as it provides a clear and structured way to access and modify the data.
