The error message "#1142 - TRIGGER command denied to user" typically occurs when the user account does not have sufficient permissions to execute a trigger command in the MySQL database.



To fix this issue, you can try the following steps:

Log in to your MySQL server with a user account that has administrative privileges.

Run the following command to grant the necessary permissions to the user:

sql
Copy code
GRANT TRIGGER ON your_database.* TO 'your_user'@'localhost';
Note: Replace "your_database" with the name of your database and "your_user" with the name of your MySQL user account.

Run the following command to flush the privileges and update the changes:
Copy code
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
Try running the trigger command again and see if the issue has been resolved.
If you still encounter the same error, you may need to review your MySQL user permissions to ensure that the user account has the necessary privileges to execute the required commands.
