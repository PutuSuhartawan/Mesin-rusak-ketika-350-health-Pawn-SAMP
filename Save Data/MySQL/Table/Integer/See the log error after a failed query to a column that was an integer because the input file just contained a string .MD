 the steps on how to activate notification log error for the error message ERROR 1364 (HY024): Field 'id' doesn't allow 'string' values (1 row affected):

Open the MySQL configuration file. This file is typically located at /etc/mysql/my.cnf.
Find the section that contains the log_error directive.
Add the following line to the log_error directive:
ERROR 1364 (HY024): Field 'id' doesn't allow 'string' values (1 row affected)
Save the configuration file.
Restart the MySQL server.
Once you have completed these steps, MySQL will log the error message ERROR 1364 (HY024): Field 'id' doesn't allow 'string' values (1 row affected) whenever it occurs.

Here is an example of how the configuration file would look after adding the error message to the log_error directive:

[mysqld]
log_error = /var/log/mysql/error.log
log_error_verbosity = 3

# Added this line to log the error message
ERROR 1364 (HY024): Field 'id' doesn't allow 'string' values (1 row affected)





 how you can printf log error from MySQL on pawn script about ERROR 1364 (HY024): Field 'id' doesn't allow 'string' values (1 row affected):

Code snippet
// Import the MySQL library
require("mysql.lib");

// Connect to the MySQL database
$db = mysql_connect("localhost", "username", "password");

// Select the database
mysql_select_db("database", $db);

// Try to insert a string into the `id` column
$query = "INSERT INTO `table` (`id`, `name`) VALUES ('string', 'name')";
$result = mysql_query($query, $db);

// Check if the query was successful
if ($result === false) {
  // The query failed, so print the error message
  printf("ERROR 1364 (HY024): Field 'id' doesn't allow 'string' values (1 row affected)\n");
}

This code will first import the MySQL library, then connect to the MySQL database. Next, it will try to insert a string into the id column. If the query is successful, the code will do nothing. However, if the query fails, the code will print the error message ERROR 1364 (HY024): Field 'id' doesn't allow 'string' values (1 row affected).

To run this code, you can save it as a file called error.pawn and then run it from the command line:

pawn error.pawn
This will print the error message to the console if the query fails.







ways to see the log error after a failed query to a column that was an integer because the input file just contained a string:

Check the database server logs. The database server will typically log all errors that occur, including errors that occur when a query fails. You can check the database server logs to see the error message that was generated when the query failed.
Use the SHOW ERRORS statement. The SHOW ERRORS statement will display all of the errors that have occurred since the last time the database was started. You can use this statement to see the error message that was generated when the query failed.
Use the ERRORLOG table. The ERRORLOG table is a system table that stores all of the errors that have occurred in the database. You can query the ERRORLOG table to see the error message that was generated when the query failed.
Here are some examples of how to use these methods to see the log error:

To check the database server logs, you can use the following command:
cat /var/log/mysql/error.log
To use the SHOW ERRORS statement, you can use the following command:
SHOW ERRORS;
To query the ERRORLOG table, you can use the following command:
SELECT * FROM ERRORLOG;
The error message that is generated when a query fails will typically include the following information:

The SQL statement that was executed
The data type of the column that the error occurred in
The value that was attempted to be inserted into the column
The error message
Once you have the error message, you can use it to troubleshoot the problem and determine why the query failed.



 a code error log error after a failed query to a column that was an integer because the input file just contained a string:

ERROR 1364 (HY024): Field 'id' doesn't allow 'string' values (1 row affected)
This error message indicates that the id column is defined as an integer, but the value "string" was attempted to be inserted into the column. The error message also indicates that one row was affected by the error.

Here is an explanation of the error message:

ERROR 1364: This is the error code for the "Field doesn't allow this type of value" error.
HY024: This is the SQLSTATE code for the same error.
Field 'id': This is the name of the column that the error occurred in.
doesn't allow 'string' values: This indicates that the column is defined as an integer and cannot accept string values.
(1 row affected): This indicates that one row was affected by the error.
If you see this error message, you can troubleshoot the problem by checking the following:

Make sure that the data type of the column is correct.
Make sure that the value that is being inserted into the column is of the correct data type.
Check the input file to make sure that the value that is being inserted into the column is valid.
