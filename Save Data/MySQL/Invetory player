First, you will need to include the MySQL plugin in your script. You can do this by adding the following line at the top of your script:

pawn
Copy code
#include <mysql>
Next, you will need to define your MySQL database connection details. You can do this by creating a global variable to store the database connection:

pawn
Copy code
new mysql;
Then, you will need to connect to your MySQL database by calling the mysql_connect() function:

pawn
Copy code
mysql = mysql_connect("localhost", "username", "password", "database", 0, 0, 0);
Replace "localhost", "username", "password", and "database" with your actual database connection details.

Once you have established a connection to your MySQL database, you can save inventory data using the mysql_query() function. For example, to save a player's inventory data, you could use a function like this:

pawn
Copy code
public SavePlayerInventory(playerid)
{
    new query[128];
    format(query, sizeof(query), "UPDATE players SET inventory='%s' WHERE id='%d'", GetPlayerInventory(playerid), playerid);
    mysql_query(mysql, query);
}
In this example, GetPlayerInventory() is a custom function that returns a string containing the player's inventory data in a format that can be stored in MySQL. You will need to define this function yourself based on how you want to store the inventory data.

To call the SavePlayerInventory() function, you can use the OnPlayerDisconnect callback, which is triggered when a player disconnects from the server:

pawn
Copy code
public OnPlayerDisconnect(playerid, reason)
{
    SavePlayerInventory(playerid);
    return 1;
}
In this example, SavePlayerInventory() is called to save the player's inventory data when they disconnect from the server.

Remember to close your MySQL database connection when your script finishes running, using the mysql_close() function:

pawn
Copy code
mysql_close(mysql);
I hope this example helps you get started with saving inventory data in MySQL for your GTA SAMP server.
