 create a premium server with this requirement, here are some steps you can take:

Set up a website where users can create an account and link their Coinbase wallet to it.
Create a custom login system for your server that requires users to log in through your website using their account and Coinbase wallet.
When users log in, check their account status to ensure they have paid for access to the premium server. If they have not paid, deny them access.
If a user's account status changes, update their status in your server's database and deny access if necessary.
Keep in mind that this approach requires significant development skills and resources. Additionally, it may not be a popular choice among potential players who prefer to use other payment methods or who are hesitant to link their Coinbase wallet to a game server.
