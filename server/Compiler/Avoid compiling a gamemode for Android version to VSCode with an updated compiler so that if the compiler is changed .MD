here are the reasons why the .amx file might error after using VSCode for compiling the .pwn file if editing a gamemode from Android version:

The .pwn file might not be compatible with the Android compiler. The Android compiler has a different set of functions and macros than the PC compiler, so the .pwn file might not be able to compile correctly.
The .amx file might contain errors. Even if the .pwn file is compatible with the Android compiler, the .amx file might still contain errors. These errors could be syntax errors, logic errors, or other types of errors.
The VSCode settings might not be correct. The VSCode settings might not be configured correctly for the Android compiler. This could cause the .amx file to compile incorrectly.
To troubleshoot this issue, you can try the following:

Check the compatibility of the .pwn file with the Android compiler. You can do this by checking the documentation for the Android compiler.
Check the .amx file for errors. You can do this by using a text editor or a code checker to look for errors in the .amx file.
Configure the VSCode settings for the Android compiler. You can do this by following the instructions in the documentation for VSCode.
If you are still having problems compiling the .amx file, you can try asking for help on a forum or in a chat room. There are many people who are experienced in compiling .amx files, and they might be able to help you troubleshoot the issue.



 here are the steps to make compiling a gamemode for Android version successful on compiler, using just Pawno editor and compile it at the same editor so the compiler just normal to running for successful result compile:

Install Pawno editor. You can download Pawno editor from the Pawno website.
Open the gamemode file in Pawno editor. The gamemode file is typically named gamemode.pwn.
Compile the gamemode file in Pawno editor. You can do this by clicking on the "Compile" button in the Pawno editor.
Check the output of the compiler. The output of the compiler will be displayed in the Pawno editor. If there are any errors, you will need to fix the errors before you can compile the gamemode file.
Run the gamemode file on an Android device. You can do this by copying the gamemode file to an Android device and running it using a file manager.
Here are some additional tips for compiling gamemodes for Android:

Use the latest version of Pawno editor. The latest version of Pawno editor includes support for compiling gamemodes for Android.

Check the gamemode file for errors. You can do this by using a text editor or a code checker to look for errors in the gamemode file.





here are the steps to avoid compiling a gamemode for Android version to VSCode with an updated compiler so that if the compiler is changed, the compiling will fail:

Do not use the sampctl compile command to compile the gamemode file. The sampctl compile command uses the latest version of the compiler, which could change at any time.
Instead, use the sampctl compile-android command to compile the gamemode file. The sampctl compile-android command uses a specific version of the compiler, which will not change unless you manually change it.
Make sure that the version of the compiler that you are using is compatible with the Android version of the gamemode. You can check the compatibility of the compiler by checking the documentation for the Android compiler.
Check the gamemode file for errors. You can do this by using a text editor or a code checker to look for errors in the gamemode file.
Here are some additional tips for avoiding compiling gamemodes for Android with an updated compiler:

Use the latest version of VSCode. The latest version of VSCode includes support for the sampctl compile-android command.
Make sure that the gamemode file is compatible with the latest version of the Android compiler. The Android compiler is constantly being updated, so you need to make sure that the gamemode file is compatible with the latest version.
Check the gamemode file for errors regularly. Errors in the gamemode file can cause the compiler to fail, so you need to check the gamemode file for errors regularly.
