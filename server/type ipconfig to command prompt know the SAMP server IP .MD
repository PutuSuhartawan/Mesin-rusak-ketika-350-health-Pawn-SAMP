reasons why you need to access Windows + R for CMD, and then type ipconfig to know the SAMP server IP:

The Windows + R keyboard shortcut opens the Run dialog box. This dialog box allows you to run programs and open files without having to navigate through the Start menu or File Explorer.
The CMD command prompt is a powerful tool that can be used to execute a variety of tasks, including displaying network configuration information. The ipconfig command specifically displays the IP address, subnet mask, and default gateway for all network adapters on your computer.
The SAMP server IP is the IP address of the computer that is running the SAMP server. This IP address is needed to connect to the SAMP server and join a game.
To find the SAMP server IP using the CMD command prompt, follow these steps:

Press Windows + R to open the Run dialog box.
Type "cmd" and press Enter.
At the command prompt, type "ipconfig" and press Enter.
Look for the line that says "IPv4 Address". This is the IP address of your computer.
If you are connecting to a SAMP server that is running on a different computer, you will need to find the IP address of that computer. You can do this by asking the administrator of the SAMP server for the IP address.
Once you have found the SAMP server IP, you can connect to the server by using the IP address in the SAMP client.
