SAMP server crashes can have various causes. Here are some general steps you can take to troubleshoot the issue: 

Check server logs: Before doing anything else, check the server logs for any error messages that could indicate the cause of the crash. The log file should be located in the "logs" folder of your SAMP server directory. Look for any error messages or warnings that might indicate the cause of the crash.

Update server: Make sure you are running the latest version of SAMP server. Sometimes, crashes are caused by outdated software. Visit the SAMP website to check for updates.

Disable plugins: If you are running any plugins, try disabling them one by one to see if one of them is causing the crash. To disable a plugin, simply remove its .dll or .so file from the "plugins" folder.

Disable filterscripts: If you are running any filterscripts, try disabling them one by one to see if one of them is causing the crash. To disable a filterscript, simply remove its .amx or .so file from the "filterscripts" folder.

Check system requirements: Make sure your server meets the minimum system requirements to run SAMP server. Check the SAMP website for the latest system requirements.

Reinstall server: If none of the above steps work, try reinstalling the SAMP server from scratch. Make sure to backup any important data before doing so.

Seek help: If you are still unable to resolve the issue, seek help from the SAMP community. There are various forums and Discord servers where you can ask for help and get support from experienced SAMP users.
