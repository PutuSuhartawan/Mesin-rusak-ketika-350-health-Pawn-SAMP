here are the steps on how to make a gamemode backup file .axm and .pwn to avoid fail for compiler:

Open the gamemode samp file in a text editor.
Find the section that starts with /** Backup Settings */.
Check the values for the backup_axm and backup_pwn settings. These settings control whether or not a backup file is created for the .axm and .pwn files, respectively.
If you want to create a backup file for the .axm and .pwn files, set the backup_axm and backup_pwn settings to true.
Once you have set the backup_axm and backup_pwn settings, save the gamemode samp file.
Once you have saved the gamemode samp file, every time you compile the gamemode, a backup file will be created for the .axm and .pwn files. This will help you to avoid losing your work if the compiler fails.

Here are some additional things to keep in mind:

The backup files will be created in the same directory as the original files.
The backup files will have the same name as the original files, but with the .bak extension.
If you already have a backup file for the .axm and .pwn files, you can overwrite the backup files by setting the backup_axm and backup_pwn settings to false.
I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
