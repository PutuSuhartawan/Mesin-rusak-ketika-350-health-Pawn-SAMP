To manage your SA-MP gamemode on a LemeHost server using VSCode, you'll need to follow these steps:

Connect to your LemeHost server using an FTP client like FileZilla. You'll need to enter your server's FTP login credentials to connect.

Navigate to the directory where your SA-MP server files are stored on the LemeHost server. This is usually located in the "samp03" folder.

Download the gamemode file that you want to edit to your local machine using the FTP client.

Install the SA-MP plugin for VSCode. You can do this by searching for "SA-MP" in the VSCode Extensions Marketplace and installing the "SA-MP PAWN" plugin.

Open the gamemode file in VSCode by clicking "File" > "Open File" and selecting the downloaded gamemode file.

Edit the gamemode file as needed using the PAWN language features provided by the SA-MP PAWN plugin.

Once you've finished editing, save the changes to the gamemode file.

Upload the updated gamemode file to your LemeHost server using the FTP client. Be sure to replace the old gamemode file with the new one.

Restart your SA-MP server to apply the changes to the gamemode.

It's important to note that editing a gamemode file requires a good understanding of programming concepts and the PAWN language. Be sure to test your changes thoroughly before applying them to your production server to avoid any issues.
