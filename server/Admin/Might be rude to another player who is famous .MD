There are a few reasons why an admin of a GTA SAMP server might be rude to another player who is famous.

* **Jealousy:** Some admins may be jealous of the fame and attention that other players receive. They may feel that they are not getting the recognition that they deserve, and this may lead them to be rude to other players in an attempt to make themselves feel better.
* **A sense of superiority:** Some admins may feel that they are superior to other players, simply because they are admins. They may believe that they have the right to treat other players however they want, and this may lead them to be rude.
* **A power trip:** Some admins may simply enjoy the power that they have over other players. They may enjoy being able to ban players, kick players, and mute players, and they may use this power to bully other players.
* **A personal vendetta:** In some cases, an admin may be rude to another player because they have a personal vendetta against that player. This could be due to something that the player said or did in the past, or it could be due to something that the player is doing on the server.

It is important to remember that not all admins are rude. There are many admins who are kind and helpful, and who are dedicated to providing a positive gaming experience for all players. However, there are also a few admins who are rude and power-hungry. If you encounter an admin who is rude to you, the best thing to do is to report them to the server owner.


There are a few reasons why an admin might give some money/game currency to the victim after being rude to them.

* **To apologize:** The admin may feel bad for being rude and want to make it up to the victim.
* **To try to make the victim forget what happened:** The admin may hope that by giving the victim some money/game currency, they will forget about the rude behavior and continue playing on the server.
* **To try to keep the victim from reporting them:** The admin may be worried that the victim will report them for being rude, so they give them some money/game currency in an attempt to keep them quiet.

It is important to note that none of these reasons are valid excuses for being rude. If an admin is rude to you, the best thing to do is to report them to the server owner.
