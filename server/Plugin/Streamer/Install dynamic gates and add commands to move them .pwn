script that demonstrates how to install dynamic gates and add commands to move them:



arduino
Copy code
#include <a_samp>
#include <dynamic_gates>

new DynamicGate:gate1, DynamicGate:gate2;

public OnGameModeInit()
{
    // Create two dynamic gates
    gate1 = DynamicGate_Create(1234, 5678, 0.0, 0.0, 5.0, 5.0, 0.0, 90.0, 0.0);
    gate2 = DynamicGate_Create(9876, 5432, 0.0, 0.0, 5.0, 5.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0);
}

public OnPlayerCommandText(playerid, cmdtext[])
{
    new cmd[32];
    sscanf(cmdtext, "s%[^\n]", cmd);

    // Check if the command is "/movegate1"
    if(!strcmp(cmd, "movegate1", true))
    {
        DynamicGate_Move(gate1, 100.0, 200.0, 0.0, 0.0, 5.0, 5.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0);
        SendClientMessage(playerid, -1, "Gate 1 has been moved.");
        return 1;
    }

    // Check if the command is "/movegate2"
    if(!strcmp(cmd, "movegate2", true))
    {
        DynamicGate_Move(gate2, 500.0, 600.0, 0.0, 0.0, 5.0, 5.0, 0.0, 90.0, 0.0);
        SendClientMessage(playerid, -1, "Gate 2 has been moved.");
        return 1;
    }

    return 0;
}
This script includes the dynamic_gates library, which provides functions for creating and moving dynamic gates. In the OnGameModeInit function, we create two dynamic gates using the DynamicGate_Create function. The arguments specify the gate's initial position, size, rotation, and elevation.

In the OnPlayerCommandText function, we check for two commands: /movegate1 and /movegate2. If the player enters one of these commands, we call the DynamicGate_Move function to move the corresponding gate to a new position and rotation. We also send a message to the player indicating that the gate has been moved.

To add this script to your server, you'll need to compile it using a PAWN compiler and add it to your server's script directory. You'll also need to add an include statement for the dynamic_gates library, which provides the DynamicGate_Create and DynamicGate_Move functions used in the script. Finally, you'll need to add a callback function to your server script that calls the OnPlayerCommandText function to check for gate movement commands entered by players.
