edit the attached object on a vehicle using the Streamer plugin in SAMP:

callback function that can be used with SetObjectPos to attach an object to a vehicle using the plugin streamer in SA:MP:

pawn
Copy code
// Callback function for SetObjectPos
public OnSetObjectPos(objectid)
{
    new vehicleid = GetPlayerVehicleID(GetPlayerIDForPlayerName("playername"));

    if(vehicleid != INVALID_VEHICLE_ID)
    {
        // Set the position of the object relative to the vehicle
        SetObjectPos(objectid, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0);
        // Attach the object to the vehicle
        AttachObjectToVehicle(objectid, vehicleid, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0);
    }
    return 1;
}
This callback function will be triggered every time an object's position is set using the SetObjectPos function. It checks if the player named "playername" is in a vehicle, and if so, it sets the position of the object relative to the vehicle and attaches it to the vehicle. You can modify this code to suit your specific needs.

Copy code
CMD:editvehicleobject(playerid, params[])
{
    new vehicleid = GetPlayerVehicleID(playerid);
    if (vehicleid != INVALID_VEHICLE_ID)
    {
        new attachedobjectid = GetVehicleAttachedObject(vehicleid);
        if (attachedobjectid != INVALID_OBJECT_ID)
        {
            // Get the position and rotation of the attached object
            new Float:pos[3], Float:rot[3];
            GetObjectPos(attachedobjectid, pos[0], pos[1], pos[2]);
            GetObjectRot(attachedobjectid, rot[0], rot[1], rot[2]);

            // Edit the position and rotation of the attached object based on the params
            if (sscanf(params, "f[3]f[3]", pos, rot) == 6)
            {
                SetObjectPos(attachedobjectid, pos[0], pos[1], pos[2]);
                SetObjectRot(attachedobjectid, rot[0], rot[1], rot[2]);

                // Send a message to the player indicating success
                SendClientMessage(playerid, COLOR_WHITE, "Attached object position and rotation edited successfully!");
            }
            else
            {
                SendClientMessage(playerid, COLOR_WHITE, "Usage: /editvehicleobject [x y z] [rx ry rz]");
            }
        }
        else
        {
            SendClientMessage(playerid, COLOR_WHITE, "This vehicle does not have an attached object.");
        }
    }
    else
    {
        SendClientMessage(playerid, COLOR_WHITE, "You are not in a vehicle.");
    }
    return 1;
}
This command takes in the player ID and the params as input. It first checks if the player is in a vehicle and if that vehicle has an attached object. If it does, it retrieves the position and rotation of the attached object and edits it based on the params. The params are expected to be two sets of three floats, representing the new position and rotation of the object. Finally, it sends a message to the player indicating success or failure.
