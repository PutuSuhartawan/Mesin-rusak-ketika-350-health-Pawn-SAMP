 here are the native functions that are available if you are using the PawnCmd plugin:

PC_SetFlags: This native function allows you to set the flags for a command. Flags are used to control the behavior of a command. For example, you can use flags to prevent a command from being executed by players or to make a command only available to certain players.
PC_GetFlags: This native function allows you to get the flags for a command. This can be useful for debugging or for checking the permissions for a command.
PC_EmulateCommand: This native function allows you to emulate the execution of a command. This can be useful for debugging or for testing the behavior of a command.
PC_RenameCommand: This native function allows you to rename a command. This can be useful for changing the name of a command or for making a command more user-friendly.
PC_DeleteCommand: This native function allows you to delete a command. This can be useful for removing unused commands or for cleaning up the command list.
Here are some additional details about each of these native functions:

PC_SetFlags: The PC_SetFlags native function takes two parameters: the name of the command and a bitmask of flags. The bitmask can be used to set the flags for the command. For example, the following code would set the PC_FLAG_ADMIN flag for the ban command:
Code snippet
PC_SetFlags("ban", PC_FLAG_ADMIN);
Use code with caution. Learn more
PC_GetFlags: The PC_GetFlags native function takes one parameter: the name of the command. The function returns a bitmask of flags that are set for the command. For example, the following code would get the flags for the ban command:
Code snippet
int flags = PC_GetFlags("ban");
Use code with caution. Learn more
PC_EmulateCommand: The PC_EmulateCommand native function takes two parameters: the name of the command and a list of parameters. The function emulates the execution of the command, but it does not actually execute the command. This can be useful for debugging or for testing the behavior of a command. For example, the following code would emulate the execution of the ban command with the parameter "42":
Code snippet
PC_EmulateCommand("ban", "42");
Use code with caution. Learn more
PC_RenameCommand: The PC_RenameCommand native function takes two parameters: the old name of the command and the new name of the command. The function renames the command. For example, the following code would rename the ban command to ban_player:
Code snippet
PC_RenameCommand("ban", "ban_player");
Use code with caution. Learn more
PC_DeleteCommand: The PC_DeleteCommand native function takes one parameter: the name of the command. The function deletes the command. For example, the following code would delete the ban command:
Code snippet
PC_DeleteCommand("ban");
Use code with caution. Learn more



here is a script that shows how to make a command with the PawnCmd plugin:

Code snippet
#include <Pawn.CMD>

cmd:mycmd(playerid, params[])
{
    // This is the code that will be executed when the command is run.
    SendClientMessage(playerid, 0xFFFFFFFF, "You ran the mycmd command!");
    return 1;
}

public OnPlayerCommandReceived(playerid, cmd[], params[], flags)
{
    if (cmd == "mycmd")
    {
        // This code will be executed if the command is "mycmd".
        return cmd:mycmd(playerid, params);
    }
    return 0;
}
Use code with caution. Learn more
This script defines a command called mycmd. The mycmd command takes no parameters and it prints a message to the player who ran the command. The OnPlayerCommandReceived function is called when a player runs a command. This function checks if the command is mycmd and if it is, it then calls the mycmd function. The mycmd function is the code that is executed when the mycmd command is run.

To use this script, you would need to compile it and then add it to your gamemode. Once you have added the script to your gamemode, you can run the mycmd command from within the game. For example, you could type /mycmd in the chatbox to run the mycmd command.
