The Metro theme is a design language created by Microsoft that is focused on typography and simplified icons, absence of clutter, increased content to chrome ratio ("content before chrome"), and basic geometric shapes. Early examples of MDL principles can be found in Encarta 95 and MSN 2.0. The design language evolved in Windows Media Center and Zune and was formally introduced as Metro during the unveiling of Windows Phone 7.

The Metro theme was designed to be a more modern and visually appealing alternative to the traditional Windows user interface. It uses a minimalist design with flat colors and simple icons, which can be more aesthetically pleasing than the default theme. The Metro theme is also more responsive, using a CSS framework that makes it more fluid and interactive.

The Metro theme was first introduced in Windows Phone 7 in 2010. It was later adopted for Windows 8 and Windows 10. The Metro theme has also been used in other Microsoft products, such as the Xbox One and the Surface devices.
