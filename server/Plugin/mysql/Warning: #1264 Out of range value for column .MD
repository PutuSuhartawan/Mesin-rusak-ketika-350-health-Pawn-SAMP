 here are the steps on how to change the column type data to BIGINT:

Connect to your MySQL database.
Use the ALTER TABLE statement to change the data type of the column. For example, the following query will change the data type of the cash column to BIGINT:
SQL
ALTER TABLE table_name ALTER COLUMN cash BIGINT;
Use code with caution. Learn more
Save the changes to the database.
Here is an explanation of the steps above:

Connecting to your MySQL database. You can use the mysql command-line client or a graphical tool like phpMyAdmin to connect to your MySQL database.
Using the ALTER TABLE statement to change the data type of the column. The ALTER TABLE statement is used to change the structure of a table. In this case, we are using the ALTER TABLE statement to change the data type of the cash column to BIGINT.
Saving the changes to the database. Once you have made the changes to the ALTER TABLE statement, you need to save the changes to the database. You can do this by typing COMMIT at the command prompt or by clicking the "Save" button in phpMyAdmin.
I hope this helps!

Here are some additional things to keep in mind when changing the column type data to BIGINT:

If the column already contains data, you will need to update the data to the new data type.
If the column is a primary key or a foreign key, you will need to update the indexes that reference the column.
If the column is used in any constraints, you will need to update the constraints to reflect the new data type.
It is important to test the changes to make sure that they work as expected. You can do this by running some queries against the table.





 here are some of the data types that you can use to store larger values:

BIGINT stores integers with a maximum value of 9223372036854775807.
DECIMAL stores decimal numbers with a precision of up to 38 digits and a scale of up to 30 digits.
FLOAT stores floating-point numbers with a precision of up to 24 digits.
DOUBLE stores floating-point numbers with a precision of up to 53 digits.
The data type that you choose will depend on the specific needs of your application. For example, if you need to store very large integers, then you would use the BIGINT data type. If you need to store decimal numbers with a high degree of precision, then you would use the DECIMAL data type.

Here is a table that shows the maximum values for some of the data types:

Data Type	Maximum Value
TINYINT	255
SMALLINT	65535
MEDIUMINT	16777215
INT	2147483647
BIGINT	9223372036854775807
DECIMAL	1.175494351e+308
FLOAT	3.402823466e+38
DOUBLE	1.7976931348623157e+308






The error message "Warning: #1264 Out of range value for column 'cash' at row 1" means that the value that you are trying to insert into the cash column is out of range for the data type of the column.

To fix this error, you need to make sure that the value that you are trying to insert is within the range of the data type of the column. For example, if the cash column is an integer, then the value that you are trying to insert must be an integer that is within the range of the integer data type.

Here are some possible solutions to fix the error:

Check the value that you are trying to insert and make sure that it is within the range of the data type of the column.
Change the data type of the column to a larger data type that can accommodate the value that you are trying to insert.
Use a different column to store the value that you are trying to insert.
For example, if the cash column is an integer and the value that you are trying to insert is 1000000, then you could change the data type of the column to BIGINT. This would allow you to insert the value 1000000 into the column.

You could also use a different column to store the value. For example, you could create a new column called total_cash and store the value 1000000 in that column.
