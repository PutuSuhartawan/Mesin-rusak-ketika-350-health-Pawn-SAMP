The benefit of the script is that it will prevent your server from crashing if there is a problem connecting to the MySQL server.

The script checks the value of the mysql_errno() function, which returns an error number if there is a problem connecting to the MySQL server. If the mysql_errno() function returns a non-zero value, the script will print a message to the console, send the exit Rcon command, and return 0. This will prevent your server from crashing and will allow you to troubleshoot the problem connecting to the MySQL server.

Here is a breakdown of the script:

Code snippet
if(mysql_errno(connectionID))
{
    print("Unable to establish a connection with the MySQL server...");
    SendRconCommand("exit");
    return 0;
}

The if(mysql_errno(connectionID)) statement checks the value of the mysql_errno() function.
If the mysql_errno() function returns a non-zero value, the if statement will execute the following statements:
The print("Unable to establish a connection with the MySQL server..."); statement will print a message to the console.
The SendRconCommand("exit"); statement will send the exit Rcon command.
The return 0; statement will return 0.
If the mysql_errno() function returns a zero value, the if statement will not execute and the script will continue to the next line.
