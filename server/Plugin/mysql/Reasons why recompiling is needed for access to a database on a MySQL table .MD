here are the steps on how to make keep User accounts as root for easy access from gamemode SAMP plugin:

Open the config.inc.php file in a text editor.
Find the section that starts with /** Authentication Settings */.
Set the user and password settings to root.
Save the config.inc.php file.
Once you have saved the config.inc.php file, all user accounts will be able to access the gamemode SAMP plugin as root.

Here are some additional things to keep in mind:

The user and password settings are case-sensitive, so make sure that you are entering the correct capitalization.
If you are not sure how to edit the config.inc.php file, you can search online for tutorials on how to edit PHP files.
Warning:

It is important to note that keeping all user accounts as root is a security risk. If an attacker gains access to one of your user accounts, they will have full access to your SAMP server.

If you are concerned about security, you should create a separate user account for the gamemode SAMP plugin and give that user account only the permissions that it needs.

here are some reasons why recompiling is needed for access to a database on a MySQL table:

Changes to the database schema: If you make changes to the database schema, such as adding a new column or changing the data type of an existing column, you will need to recompile the database in order for the changes to take effect.
Changes to the MySQL server: If you update the MySQL server software, you may need to recompile the database in order for the changes to take effect.
Corrupted database files: If the database files become corrupted, you may need to recompile the database in order to repair the damage.
In general, you should always recompile the database after making any changes to the database schema or the MySQL server software. This will help to ensure that the database is up-to-date and that it is functioning properly.

Here are some additional things to keep in mind:

Recompiling the database can be a time-consuming process, so it is important to make sure that you have a backup of the database before you start.
If you are not sure how to recompile the database, you can search online for tutorials on how to do so.
