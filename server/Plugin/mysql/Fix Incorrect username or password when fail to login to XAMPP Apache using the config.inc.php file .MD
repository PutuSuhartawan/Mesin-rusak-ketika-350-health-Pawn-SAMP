here are the steps on how to fix Incorrect username or password when fail to login to XAMPP Apache using the config.inc.php file:

Open the config.inc.php file in a text editor.
Find the section that starts with /** Authentication Settings */.
Check the values for the user and password settings. Make sure that these values match the username and password you are trying to use to login to Apache.
If the values for the user and password settings are correct, but you are still getting an error, you may need to create a new user account for Apache.
To create a new user account, you will need to add a new entry to the /** Authentication Settings */ section of the config.inc.php file. The new entry should look like this:
PHP
$cfg['Servers']['default']['auth']['user'] = 'new_username';
$cfg['Servers']['default']['auth']['password'] = 'new_password';
Use code with caution. Learn more
Replace new_username and new_password with the username and password you want to use for the new user account.

Once you have added the new entry to the config.inc.php file, you will need to restart Apache.
Once you have restarted Apache, you should be able to login to Apache using the new username and password you created.

Here are some additional things to keep in mind:

The username and password settings are case-sensitive, so make sure that you are entering the correct capitalization.
If you are still having problems logging in, you can try creating a new user account for Apache with the root user. This will give you a new username and password that you can use to login.
I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
