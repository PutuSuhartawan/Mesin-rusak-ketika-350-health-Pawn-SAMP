here are some reasons why you might fail to login to XAMPP Apache:

Incorrect username or password: If you enter the wrong username or password, you will not be able to login.
Wrong port: If you are trying to login to Apache on a port other than 80 or 443, you will need to specify the correct port in the URL. For example, to login to Apache on port 8080, you would need to use the URL http://localhost:8080.
Apache is not running: If Apache is not running, you will not be able to login. You can check if Apache is running by opening a command prompt or terminal window and typing the following command:
Code snippet
sudo service apache2 status

If the output of the command shows that Apache is running, then the problem is something else.

Firewall blocking access: If your firewall is blocking access to Apache, you will not be able to login. You can check if your firewall is blocking access by opening the firewall settings and making sure that Apache is allowed to connect.
Corrupt configuration files: If the configuration files for Apache are corrupt, you may not be able to login. You can try restarting Apache to see if this fixes the problem. If it does not, you may need to edit the configuration files to correct the errors.

here are the steps on how to not change the config.inc.php file but just change the gamemode values for the host, username, password, and database for the same value:

Open the gamemode samp file in a text editor.
Find the section that starts with mysql_host = "localhost".
Update the values for the host, username, password, and database settings to the same values as those in the config.inc.php file.
Save the gamemode samp file.
Here is an example of what the two files might look like:

Gamemode samp file:

Code snippet
mysql_host = "localhost"
mysql_username = "root"
mysql_password = "password"
mysql_database = "samp"
Use code with caution. Learn more
Config.inc.php file:

Code snippet
/** MySQL settings */

$cfg['Servers']['default']['host'] = "localhost";
$cfg['Servers']['default']['user'] = "root";
$cfg['Servers']['default']['password'] = "password";
$cfg['Servers']['default']['database'] = "samp";
Use code with caution. Learn more
Once you have made the changes to the gamemode samp file, you should be able to connect to the database without having to change the config.inc.php file.

Here are some additional things to keep in mind:

The values for the host, username, password, and database settings must be the same in both files.
If you are not sure what the values for these settings are, you can check the config.inc.php file or your phpMyAdmin installation.
It is a good idea to create a backup of the gamemode samp file before you make any changes.
I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.

Note: If you change the values for the host, username, password, or database settings in the config.inc.php file, you will also need to make the same changes to the gamemode samp file. Otherwise, you will not be able to connect to the database.
