The config.inc.php file is located in the phpMyAdmin directory of your XAMPP installation. The default path is:

Windows: C:\xampp\phpMyAdmin\config.inc.php
Linux: /opt/lampp/phpMyAdmin/config.inc.php
macOS: /Applications/XAMPP/xamppfiles/phpMyAdmin/config.inc.php
You can open the file in a text editor to view or edit its contents. However, it is important to note that this file contains sensitive information, such as your MySQL database credentials. Therefore, you should only edit it if you know what you are doing.

If you need to edit the config.inc.php file, you can do so by following these steps:

Open a command prompt or terminal window.
Navigate to the directory where the file is located.
Use a text editor to open the file.
Make the desired changes to the file.
Save the file.
Once you have saved the file, you will need to restart phpMyAdmin for the changes to take effect.

Here are some additional tips for working with the config.inc.php file:

If you are not sure what a particular setting does, you can consult the phpMyAdmin documentation.
If you make a mistake, you can always restore the original file from a backup.
It is a good idea to create a backup of the config.inc.php file before you make any changes.

There are a few reasons why you might want to make the config.inc.php file the same as the gamemode samp file when the plugin mysql is needed to connect to the database.

Security: By keeping the two files the same, you can ensure that the database credentials are only stored in one place. This makes it less likely that someone will be able to access your database if they gain access to your SAMP server.
Convenience: If you ever need to change the database credentials, you will only need to make the change in one place. This can save you time and effort.
Consistency: By keeping the two files the same, you can ensure that the database connection settings are consistent between your SAMP server and your phpMyAdmin installation. This can help to avoid errors and unexpected behavior.
However, there are also a few potential drawbacks to making the two files the same.

Complexity: If you ever need to make changes to the database connection settings, you will need to make the same changes to both files. This can be time-consuming and error-prone.
Security: If someone gains access to your SAMP server, they will also have access to your database credentials. This could allow them to steal your data or cause other problems.
Ultimately, the decision of whether or not to make the config.inc.php file the same as the gamemode samp file is a trade-off between security and convenience. If you are concerned about security, you may want to keep the two files separate. However, if you prefer the convenience of having the same settings in both files, then you may want to make them the same.

Here are some additional things to consider when making this decision:

The size and complexity of your database. If your database is large or complex, it may be more difficult to manage if the two files are separate.
The security of your SAMP server. If your SAMP server is not well-protected, then you may want to keep the two files separate to reduce the risk of someone gaining access to your database credentials.
Your own personal preferences. If you prefer the convenience of having the same settings in both files, then you may want to make them the same.

the steps on how to set the same data account from SAMP plugin mysql on gamemode to the config.inc.php file:

Open the config.inc.php file in a text editor.
Find the section that starts with /** MySQL settings */.
Copy the values for the host, username, password, and database settings from the gamemode samp file.
Paste the values into the config.inc.php file.
Save the config.inc.php file.
Here is an example of what the two files might look like:

Gamemode samp file:

Code snippet
mysql_host = "localhost"
mysql_username = "root"
mysql_password = "password"
mysql_database = "samp"

Config.inc.php file:

Code snippet
/** MySQL settings */

$cfg['Servers']['default']['host'] = "localhost";
$cfg['Servers']['default']['user'] = "root";
$cfg['Servers']['default']['password'] = "password";
$cfg['Servers']['default']['database'] = "samp";
Use code with caution. Learn more
Once you have made the changes to the config.inc.php file, you will need to restart phpMyAdmin for the changes to take effect.

Here are some additional things to keep in mind:

The values for the host, username, password, and database settings must be the same in both files.
If you are not sure what the values for these settings are, you can check the gamemode samp file or your phpMyAdmin installation.
It is a good idea to create a backup of the config.inc.php file before you make any changes.
