are the steps on how to move an item from a table to another database with the same table but different items:

Identify the source and destination databases and tables. You will need to know the names of the source database, the source table, the destination database, and the destination table.
Create a new connection to the destination database. You can do this using a tool like MySQL Workbench or a command-line tool like MySQL.
Query the source table to get the data that you want to move. You can use the SELECT statement to do this.
Insert the data into the destination table. You can use the INSERT INTO statement to do this.
Commit the changes. Once you have finished inserting the data, you will need to commit the changes to the destination database.
Here is an example of the steps above in MySQL:

SQL
# Connect to the source database
USE my_source_database;

# Query the source table
SELECT * FROM my_table;

# Connect to the destination database
USE my_destination_database;

# Insert the data into the destination table
INSERT INTO my_table (id, name, email)
SELECT id, name, email FROM my_source_table;

# Commit the changes
COMMIT;

Once you have completed these steps, the item will be moved from the source table to the destination table.

Here are some additional tips for moving items between databases:

If you are using a tool like MySQL Workbench, you can use the "Data Transfer" feature to move the data between databases.
If you are using a command-line tool like MySQL, you can use the LOAD DATA INFILE statement to move the data between databases.
If you are using a database management system other than MySQL, the steps may be slightly different. Please consult your database documentation for more information.





here are the steps on how to move an item from a table with copy first every item with select the item first. After the go to another database. Where was export the item was selected so we have the file for import this item. Then open another database a open the table with same name. So we can paste here the SQL command is. So the item was paste on another table with same name but with import SQL method:

Identify the source and destination databases and tables. You will need to know the names of the source database, the source table, the destination database, and the destination table.
Select the item that you want to move. You can use the SELECT statement to do this.
Export the selected item. You can use the LOAD DATA OUTFILE statement to do this.
Open the destination database. You can do this using a tool like MySQL Workbench or a command-line tool like MySQL.
Import the exported item. You can use the LOAD DATA INFILE statement to do this.
Here is an example of the steps above in MySQL:

SQL
# Connect to the source database
USE my_source_database;

# Select the item that you want to move
SELECT * FROM my_table WHERE id = 12345;

# Export the selected item
LOAD DATA OUTFILE '/tmp/my_item.txt' INTO TABLE my_table (id, name, email);

# Open the destination database
USE my_destination_database;

# Import the exported item
LOAD DATA INFILE '/tmp/my_item.txt' INTO TABLE my_table (id, name, email);

Once you have completed these steps, the item will be moved from the source table to the destination table.

Here are some additional tips for moving items between databases:

If you are using a tool like MySQL Workbench, you can use the "Data Transfer" feature to move the data between databases.
If you are using a command-line tool like MySQL, you can use the LOAD DATA INFILE statement to move the data between databases.
The LOAD DATA INFILE statement can only be used to import data from a text file. If you want to import data from a different format, you will need to use a different method.
