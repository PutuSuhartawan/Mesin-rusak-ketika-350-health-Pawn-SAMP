To install SQLite on your Lemehost server running Linux, you can follow the steps below:

Connect to your server using SSH. You can use a tool like PuTTY on Windows or the Terminal on macOS or Linux.

Update your package list by running the following command:

sql
Copy code
sudo apt-get update
Install SQLite by running the following command:

csharp
Copy code
sudo apt-get install sqlite3
Once the installation is complete, you can verify that SQLite is installed by running the following command:

css
Copy code
sqlite3 --version
This should display the version number of SQLite that was installed.

If you need to use SQLite in a programming language, you will also need to install the appropriate SQLite driver for that language. For example, if you are using PHP, you will need to install the PHP SQLite extension. You can use the following command to install it:

csharp
Copy code
sudo apt-get install php-sqlite3
Replace php-sqlite3 with the appropriate package name for your programming language and version.

That's it! You should now have SQLite installed on your Lemehost server running Linux, and you can start using it in your applications.
