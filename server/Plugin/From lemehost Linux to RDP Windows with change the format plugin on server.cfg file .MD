here are the steps on how to run a server SAMP from lemehost Linux to RDP Windows with change the format plugin on server.cfg file:

Install the SAMP server on the Windows machine. You can do this by following the instructions on the SAMP website.
Configure the SAMP server. You will need to edit the server.cfg file to specify the IP address and port number of the server, as well as other settings.
Change the format plugin in the server.cfg file. You can do this by editing the line that says format_plugin = "samp_plugins/format_default.so" and replacing "samp_plugins/format_default.so" with the name of the plugin that you want to use.
Start the SAMP server. You can do this by running the sampd command from the command line.
Here are the detailed steps:

Install the SAMP server on the Windows machine. You can download the SAMP server from the SAMP website. Once you have downloaded the server, you can install it by following the instructions in the README file.
Configure the SAMP server. You will need to edit the server.cfg file to specify the IP address and port number of the server, as well as other settings. The IP address and port number of the server will depend on your network configuration.
Change the format plugin in the server.cfg file. You can find the format plugin setting in the server.cfg file. The format plugin setting is the line that says format_plugin = "samp_plugins/format_default.so". You can replace "samp_plugins/format_default.so" with the name of the plugin that you want to use.
Start the SAMP server. You can start the SAMP server by running the sampd command from the command line.
Here are some additional tips for running a SAMP server on Windows:

Make sure that you have enough RAM and CPU resources available to run the server.
Make sure that you have installed the latest version of the SAMP server.
You can use a tool like Radmin to connect to the SAMP server from a remote machine.





 here are the reasons why you need to change the format plugin in the server.cfg file while using RDP Windows because the name of the plugin is different and the format, .so and .dll, is different:

The format plugin is a shared library that is used by the SAMP server to format the data that is sent to the clients. The format plugin is different for Windows and Linux, so you need to change the format plugin in the server.cfg file if you are running the SAMP server on Windows.
The format plugin is typically named format_default.so on Linux, but it is named format_default.dll on Windows. This is because the file format for shared libraries is different on Windows and Linux.
If you do not change the format plugin in the server.cfg file, the SAMP server will not be able to start on Windows. This is because the SAMP server will not be able to find the correct format plugin.
To change the format plugin in the server.cfg file, you need to edit the line that says format_plugin = "samp_plugins/format_default.so" and replace "samp_plugins/format_default.so" with the name of the format plugin that you want to use on Windows. For example, if you want to use the format_default.dll plugin, you would change the line to format_plugin = "samp_plugins/format_default.dll".

Once you have changed the format plugin in the server.cfg file, you need to restart the SAMP server. The SAMP server should now start on Windows.





here are the reasons why the name of the MySQL plugin is different on Lemehost Linux (mysql_static.so) and RDP Windows (mysql.dll):

The file format for shared libraries is different on Linux and Windows. On Linux, shared libraries are typically named with the .so extension, while on Windows, they are typically named with the .dll extension.
The MySQL plugin is statically linked on Linux, but it is dynamically linked on Windows. This means that the MySQL plugin on Linux includes all of the necessary libraries, while the MySQL plugin on Windows only includes the code that is needed to connect to the MySQL database.
The MySQL plugin on Linux is provided as a separate download, while the MySQL plugin on Windows is included in the SAMP server package. This means that you need to download the MySQL plugin separately if you are running the SAMP server on Linux, but you do not need to download it if you are running the SAMP server on Windows.
In short, the name of the MySQL plugin is different on Linux and Windows because the file format for shared libraries is different, the MySQL plugin is statically linked on Linux but dynamically linked on Windows, and the MySQL plugin on Linux is provided as a separate download, while the MySQL plugin on Windows is included in the SAMP server package.
