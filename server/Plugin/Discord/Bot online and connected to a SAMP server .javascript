To make a Discord bot online and connected to a SAMP server, you will need to do the following:

Create a Discord bot: First, you will need to create a new Discord bot and get its token. You can follow the official Discord documentation to create a bot and get its token.

Install a Discord library: You will need to install a Discord library for your preferred programming language. Some popular libraries are Discord.js for Node.js and Discord.py for Python.

Write a script: You will need to write a script that will connect to both the Discord API and the SAMP server. This script will need to handle events from Discord and SAMP, such as messages and player connections.

Host the script: Finally, you will need to host the script on a server or a hosting service. You can use services like Heroku, DigitalOcean, or AWS to host your bot.

Here is an example of how you could write a script to connect a Discord bot to a SAMP server using the Discord.js library for Node.js:

javascript
Copy code
const Discord = require('discord.js');
const { SampListener } = require('samp-query');
const bot = new Discord.Client();
const samp = new SampListener('localhost', 7777);

bot.on('ready', () => {
  console.log(`Logged in as ${bot.user.tag}!`);
});

bot.on('message', message => {
  if (message.content === 'ping') {
    message.reply('pong');
  }
});

samp.on('error', (error) => {
  console.log(`SAMP error: ${error}`);
});

samp.on('connect', () => {
  console.log('Connected to SAMP server');
});

samp.on('playerConnect', (player) => {
  bot.channels.cache.get('DISCORD_CHANNEL_ID').send(`${player.name} connected to the server`);
});

samp.on('playerDisconnect', (player) => {
  bot.channels.cache.get('DISCORD_CHANNEL_ID').send(`${player.name} disconnected from the server`);
});

bot.login('DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN');
samp.connect();
This script uses the Discord.js library to listen for messages in Discord and the SampListener library to listen for player connections and disconnections in the SAMP server. You will need to replace DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN with your actual bot token and DISCORD_CHANNEL_ID with the ID of the Discord channel you want to send messages to
