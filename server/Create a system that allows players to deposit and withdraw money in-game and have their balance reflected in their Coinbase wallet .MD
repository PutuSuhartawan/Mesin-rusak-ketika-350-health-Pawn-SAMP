general outline of the steps you can take to create a system that allows players to deposit and withdraw money in-game and have their balance reflected in their Coinbase wallet:

Set up a MySQL database to store player account information, including their in-game balance and Coinbase API key.

Use the Coinbase API to create a Coinbase API key and link it to each player's account in the database. This will allow you to access the player's Coinbase wallet information and perform transactions on their behalf.

Create functions in your Pawn script to handle deposits and withdrawals. These functions should update the player's in-game balance in the database, as well as initiate transactions through the Coinbase API to deposit or withdraw funds from their Coinbase wallet. Be sure to include error handling in case there are issues with the transaction or the Coinbase API.

Set up a cron job to regularly update the player's balance in the database to match their Coinbase wallet balance. This can be done by querying the Coinbase API for the player's wallet balance and updating the database accordingly.

Implement a transfer system that allows players to transfer money to each other. When a transfer is initiated, deduct the transfer amount from the sender's balance in the database, and initiate a transaction through the Coinbase API to transfer the funds from the sender's Coinbase wallet to the recipient's Coinbase wallet. Be sure to include a fee for the transfer (such as the Coinbase transfer fee) and deduct this from the transfer amount.

Set up a system to track transactions and transaction history. This can be done by creating a separate table in the database to store transaction information, such as the sender, recipient, transfer amount, and transaction date.

Overall, implementing a system to link in-game currency with a player's Coinbase wallet can be complex and may require some advanced programming skills. Be sure to thoroughly test your system and implement appropriate security measures to protect players' personal and financial information.
