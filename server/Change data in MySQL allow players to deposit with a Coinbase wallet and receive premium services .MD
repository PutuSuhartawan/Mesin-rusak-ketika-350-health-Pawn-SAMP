To change data in MySQL on a SA-MP server to allow players to deposit with a Coinbase wallet and receive premium services on the server, you'll need to follow these steps:

Create a table in the MySQL database to store the user's account information, including their username, password, email, and premium status. You can use a tool like phpMyAdmin to create the table and set up the columns.

Install the Coinbase API SDK for PHP on your server. You can download the SDK from the Coinbase GitHub repository.

Create a PHP script that connects to the Coinbase API and handles the deposit and withdrawal transactions. This script should interact with the MySQL database to update the user's account balance and premium status.

Update the gamemode to use the new PHP script to handle the deposit and withdrawal transactions. You can use the OnPlayerCommandText callback to detect when a player enters a command to deposit or withdraw funds and call the PHP script to handle the transaction.

Update the gamemode to check the user's premium status before allowing them to access premium services. You can use the MySQL database to store the user's premium status and check it when they attempt to use a premium service.

Create a command in the gamemode that allows players to check their account balance and premium status.

Test the new system thoroughly to ensure that it works as expected and doesn't cause any issues or security vulnerabilities.

It's important to note that implementing a system like this requires a good understanding of programming concepts, MySQL, and the Coinbase API. Be sure to take all necessary precautions to protect user data and prevent fraud.
