There are a few reasons why you might lose connection to a GTA SAMP server. Here are some things you can check to try to troubleshoot the issue:

* **Your internet connection:** Make sure that your internet connection is stable and has a good enough speed to play GTA SAMP. You can test your internet speed by visiting a website like speedtest.net.
* **The server you're trying to connect to:** The server you're trying to connect to might be experiencing problems. You can try connecting to a different server to see if that fixes the issue.
* **Your firewall or antivirus software:** Your firewall or antivirus software might be blocking GTA SAMP from connecting to the internet. Try disabling your firewall or antivirus software and see if that fixes the issue.
* **Your router:** Your router might be misconfigured or outdated. Try restarting your router or updating its firmware.
* **Your GTA SAMP settings:** Make sure that your GTA SAMP settings are correct. For example, make sure that you have the correct server IP address and port number.

If you've checked all of these things and you're still having problems, you can try contacting the server administrator for help.

Here are some additional tips for testing your ping:

* Use a reliable ping testing website or app.
* Test your ping to multiple servers to get an average.
* Test your ping at different times of day to see if there are any patterns.
* If you're experiencing high ping, try connecting to a server that's closer to you.
* You can also try using a VPN to improve your ping.
