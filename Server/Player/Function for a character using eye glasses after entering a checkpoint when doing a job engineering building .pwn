Copy code
// Function to give eye glasses to a player after entering a checkpoint

{
    // Check if the player is in a checkpoint related to engineering building job
    if(GetPlayerCheckpoint(playerid) == ENGINEERING_BUILDING_CHECKPOINT)
    {
        // Give the player eye glasses
        GivePlayerItem(playerid, ITEM_EYE_GLASSES, 1);
        SendClientMessage(playerid, COLOR_GREEN, "You received eye glasses for the engineering building job.");
    }
}

// Example usage
GiveEyeGlasses(playerid);
In this example, the function checks if the player is in a specific checkpoint related to the engineering building job (defined as ENGINEERING_BUILDING_CHECKPOINT). If the player is in the checkpoint, the function gives the player eye glasses (defined as ITEM_EYE_GLASSES) and sends them a message notifying them that they have received the eye glasses. You can call this function in your script whenever a player enters a checkpoint related to the engineering building job.
