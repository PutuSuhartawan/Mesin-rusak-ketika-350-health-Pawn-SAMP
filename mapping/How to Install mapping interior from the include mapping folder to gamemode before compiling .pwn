To install mapping interior from the "include/mapping" folder to your gamemode before compiling, you can follow these steps:

Download the mapping include files from the SA-MP forums or from a mapping website that provides it.
Extract the contents of the "include/mapping" folder to your gamemode's "pawno/include" directory.
Open your gamemode script in your favorite text editor.
At the top of your script, include the mapping include file by adding the following line:
pawn
Copy code
#include <mapping>
In your OnGameModeInit() function, add a call to the mapping function that loads the interior you want to use. For example, to load the Jefferson Motel interior, you would add:
pawn
Copy code
mapping_loadInterior(MAP_JEFFERSON_MOTEL);
Save your script and compile your gamemode.
Once you've compiled your gamemode with the mapping include file and the mapping_loadInterior() function call, players will be able to enter the interior you've loaded and interact with it.

Note: Make sure to read and follow any instructions or usage notes that may be provided with the mapping include files or with the specific interior mapping functions you want to use. Some interiors may require additional setup steps or configuration options to work properly.
