To add mapping to a gamemode, you can use the MapAndreas plugin for SA-MP. Here are the general steps you can follow to add mapping to your gamemode:

Download the MapAndreas plugin and add it to your server's plugins folder.
Load the plugin using the loadplugin function in your gamemode script.
Load the mapping data from a file or database using the LoadMapAndreasData function provided by the plugin. This function requires the path to the file or the SQL query to load the data.
Use the GetMapAndreasAtPoint function to get the mapping data at a specific point in the game world. This function returns the ID of the object or the material at the given coordinates.
Use the mapping data to create objects, set materials, or perform other tasks in your gamemode.
Here is some sample code to get you started:

scss
Copy code
// Load the mapping data from a file
LoadMapAndreasData("scriptfiles/mapandreas.dat");

// Get the mapping data at a specific point
new Float:x, Float:y, Float:z;
GetPlayerPos(playerid, x, y, z);
new material = GetMapAndreasAtPoint(x, y, z);

// Use the mapping data to create an object
CreateObject(18715, x, y, z, 0, 0, 0, 0, -1, -1, 10000);
SetObjectMaterial(objectid, 0, material, "model.txd", "model.dff", 0xFFFFFFFF);
Note that you will need to adjust this code to fit your specific needs and the requirements of your gamemode.
