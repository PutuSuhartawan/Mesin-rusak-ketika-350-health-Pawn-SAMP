 In order to use the cache_num_rows statement, you need to first create a new Cache object. You can do this by using the new Cache: Result statement.

Here is an example of how to do this:
<code>
new Cache: Result;

Result = mysql_query(MySQL, query);

if (Result) {
  new rows = cache_num_rows(Result);
  printf("There are %d rows in the `players` table.", rows);
}
</code>
This code will first create a new Cache object called Result. Then, the code will use the mysql_query statement to query the players table in the MySQL database. If the query is successful, the code will then get the number of rows in the result set using the cache_num_rows statement. Finally, the code will print the number of rows to the console.




the differences between mysql_query and mysql_tquery in Pawn scripting on GTA SAMP:

Feature	mysql_query	mysql_tquery
Purpose	Sends a query to the currently active database on the server that's associated with the specified link identifier.	Executes a query in a transaction.
Return value	Returns a resource on success, or FALSE on failure.	Returns a resource on success, or NULL on failure.
Error handling	If an error occurs, the mysql_error() function can be used to get the error message.	If an error occurs, the mysql_error() function can be used to get the error message. However, the mysql_tquery() function will also roll back the transaction.
Transaction support	No	Yes
Here is an example of how to use mysql_query and mysql_tquery in Pawn scripting on GTA SAMP:
<code>
Code snippet
// Create a connection to the MySQL database.
new MySQL = mysql_connect("localhost", "username", "password");

// Select the `players` table.
new query[128];
format(query, sizeof(query), "SELECT * FROM players");

// Execute the query.
new result = mysql_query(MySQL, query);

// Check if the query was successful.
if (result) {
  // Do something with the result set.
} else {
  // Handle the error.
}

// Close the connection to the MySQL database.
mysql_close(MySQL);

As you can see, the main difference between mysql_query and mysql_tquery is that mysql_tquery executes the query in a transaction. This means that if an error occurs during the query, the transaction will be rolled back and the database will be left in a consistent state.

In general, you should use mysql_tquery whenever you are executing a query that could potentially fail. This will help to ensure that your database is always in a consistent state.
