 In order to use the cache_num_rows statement, you need to first create a new Cache object. You can do this by using the new Cache: Result statement.

Here is an example of how to do this:
<code>
new Cache: Result;

Result = mysql_query(MySQL, query);

if (Result) {
  new rows = cache_num_rows(Result);
  printf("There are %d rows in the `players` table.", rows);
}</code>
This code will first create a new Cache object called Result. Then, the code will use the mysql_query statement to query the players table in the MySQL database. If the query is successful, the code will then get the number of rows in the result set using the cache_num_rows statement. Finally, the code will print the number of rows to the console.
