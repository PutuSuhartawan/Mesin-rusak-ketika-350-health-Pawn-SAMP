loading data from the cache into the PlayerInfo array. The cache_get_field_content_int() function takes two parameters: the cache ID and the field name. The function returns the integer value of the field.

In this case, the cache_get_field_content_int() function is returning the value of the locked field from the cache with the ID 0. The locked field is an integer that indicates whether or not the whitelist is locked.

The value of the locked field is then stored in the pWhitelistLocked element of the PlayerInfo array. This allows the script to access the value of the locked field from anywhere in the script.

Here is an explanation of how the code works:

The cache_get_field_content_int() function is called with the cache ID 0 and the field name "locked".
The function returns the integer value of the locked field.
The value of the locked field is stored in the pWhitelistLocked element of the PlayerInfo array.
I hope this explanation is helpful. Let me know if you have any other questions.



 PlayerInfo[MAX_PLAYERS][pWhitelistLocked] = cache_get_field_content_int(0, "locked");
