Pawn script for variable manage boolean with integer too:

Code snippet
stock ManageVariable(playerid, variable, value)
{
  // Check if the variable is already defined.
  if (!isDefined(variable))
  {
    // The variable is not defined, so define it.
    variable = 0;
  }

  // Check if the value is a boolean value.
  if (typeof(value) == TYPE_BOOL)
  {
    // The value is a boolean value, so set the variable to the value.
    variable = value;
  }
  else
  {
    // The value is not a boolean value, so convert it to a boolean value.
    variable = (value != 0);
  }

  // Return the value of the variable.
  return variable;
}

This script will first check if the variable is already defined. If the variable is not defined, the script will define the variable as 0. Then, the script will check if the value is a boolean value. If the value is a boolean value, the script will set the variable to the value. Otherwise, the script will convert the value to a boolean value and set the variable to the converted value. Finally, the script will return the value of the variable.

To use the script, you would first need to define the variable that you want to manage. Then, you would need to call the ManageVariable() function to set the value of the variable. Finally, you would need to call the ManageVariable() function to get the value of the variable.

Here is an example of how to use the script:

Code snippet
int variable;

// Set the variable to true.
ManageVariable(variable, true);

// Get the value of the variable.
int value = ManageVariable(variable);

// Check if the value is true.
if (value)
{
  // The value is true.
}





Pawn script to update and select boolean data on whitelist and unwhitelist/blacklist:

Code snippet
stock UpdateWhitelistedStatus(playerid, isWhitelisted)
{
  // Connect to the MySQL database.
  mysql_connect("localhost", "root", "", "my_database");

  // Prepare the SQL query.
  string query = "UPDATE players SET whitelisted = %d WHERE uid = %d";

  // Format the query and replace the placeholders with the actual values.
  query = format(query, isWhitelisted, playerid);

  // Execute the SQL query.
  mysql_query(query);

  // Close the connection to the MySQL database.
  mysql_close();
}

stock IsPlayerWhitelisted(playerid)
{
  // Connect to the MySQL database.
  mysql_connect("localhost", "root", "", "my_database");

  // Prepare the SQL query.
  string query = "SELECT whitelisted FROM players WHERE uid = %d";

  // Format the query and replace the placeholder with the actual value.
  query = format(query, playerid);

  // Execute the SQL query.
  int result = mysql_query(query);

  // Check if the query was successful.
  if (result != 0)
  {
    // The query was not successful.
    return false;
  }

  // Get the value of the `whitelisted` column.
  int whitelisted = mysql_result(result, 0, 0);

  // Close the connection to the MySQL database.
  mysql_close();

  // Return the value of the `whitelisted` column.
  return whitelisted;
}

This script will first connect to the MySQL database. Then, it will prepare the SQL query to update or select the whitelisted column in the players table. Finally, it will execute the SQL query and return the result.

To use the script, you would first need to create the players table in the MySQL database. Then, you would need to call the UpdateWhitelistedStatus() function to update the whitelisted column for a specific player. Finally, you would call the IsPlayerWhitelisted() function to check if a specific player is whitelisted.


change wrong data boolean while making whitelist and unwhitelist/blacklist:

Use a database. A database is a good way to store data, and it can be used to track whitelist and blacklist information. If you have a database, you can easily update the data if it is wrong.
Use a script. A script can be used to automate the process of whitelisting and blacklisting players. If you have a script, you can easily update the script if it is wrong.
Use a manual system. A manual system can be used to track whitelist and blacklist information. If you have a manual system, you can easily update the system if it is wrong.
Here are some specific examples of how to change wrong data boolean while making whitelist and unwhitelist/blacklist:

If you are using a database, you can update the data in the database. For example, if you have a table called players with a column called whitelisted that stores a boolean value, you can update the value of the whitelisted column for the player in question.
If you are using a script, you can update the script. For example, if you have a script that checks if a player is whitelisted and then takes action if they are not, you can update the script to check if the player is whitelisted and then take the appropriate action if they are not.
If you are using a manual system, you can update the system. For example, if you have a list of whitelisted players that is stored in a text file, you can update the list to remove the player in question.
It is important to note that there is no one-size-fits-all solution for changing wrong data boolean while making whitelist and unwhitelist/blacklist. The best solution will depend on the specific needs of your server.
