 here are the meanings of the ' symbol on query SQL:

**'is used to quote strings in SQL queries.** This means that any characters inside the quotes will be interpreted literally, and not as special characters. For example, the querySELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'johndoe'will select all rows from theuserstable where theusernamecolumn is equal to the stringjohndoe`.
**'can also be used to escape special characters in SQL queries.** This means that any characters that have special meaning in SQL, such as",',%, and_, can be escaped by preceding them with a'. For example, the querySELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'john'doe'will select all rows from theuserstable where theusernamecolumn is equal to the stringjohn'doe`.
Here are some examples of how the ' symbol is used in SQL queries:


<code>
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'johndoe'
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'john\'doe'
INSERT INTO users (username, password) VALUES ('johndoe', 'password123')
UPDATE users SET password = 'newpassword' WHERE username = 'johndoe'
I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.

The query you were using was incorrect because it did not specify the pw column in the whitelist table. The correct query should be:

SQL
INSERT INTO `whitelist` (`username`, `pw`) VALUES ('%s', '');

This query will insert a new row into the whitelist table, with the username and pw columns set to the values specified in the parameters.






The code you provided is a Pawn script that adds a player to the whitelist. The script first checks if the player who is executing the command has the required level of administration. If they do not, the script returns an error message. If the player does have the required level of administration, the script then parses the parameters of the command to get the username of the player to be whitelisted. The script then inserts a new row into the whitelist table in the MySQL database, with the username and password of the player to be whitelisted. The script then sets the pWhitelisted flag for the player who executed the command to 1, to indicate that they are now whitelisted. The script then sends a system message to all players, indicating that the player has been whitelisted. The script also logs the event to the log_admin file. Finally, the script prints a debug message to the console.

Here is a breakdown of the code:
<code>
Code snippet
CMD:whitelist(playerid, params[])
{


	new username[MAX_PLAYER_NAME];

	if(PlayerInfo[playerid][pAdmin] < 4)
	{
	    return SCM(playerid, COLOR_SYNTAX, "[SYSTEM]: "RED" Anda Tidak Diizinkan Menggunakan Perintah.");
	}
	if(sscanf(params, "s[24]", username))
	{
	    return SCM(playerid, COLOR_SYNTAX, "[USAGE]: /whitelist [username]");
	}

  	//mysql_format(connectionID, queryBuffer, sizeof(queryBuffer), "INSERT INTO `whitelist` SET `username` ='%s'", username);
  	mysql_format(connectionID, queryBuffer, sizeof(queryBuffer), "INSERT INTO `whitelist` (`username`, `pw`) VALUES ('%s', '')", username);
  	//INSERT INTO `whitelist` (`username`, `pw`) VALUES ('Shawn_Fernandez', '');
   	mysql_tquery(connectionID, queryBuffer);
    PlayerInfo[playerid][pWhitelisted]=1;
    SAM(COLOR_YELLOW, "[SYSTEM]: "WHITE"  %s has whitelist %s's account.", GetRPName(playerid), username);
    Log_Write("log_admin", "%s (uid: %i) whitelist %s's account.", GetPlayerNameEx(playerid), PlayerInfo[playerid][pID], username);
    printf("[cmd] %s: [%s]", GetRPName(playerid), queryBuffer);


}

The first line of the function declares the function name and the two parameters that the function takes: playerid and params. The playerid parameter is the ID of the player who executed the command, and the params parameter is a string containing the parameters of the command.

The next few lines of code check if the player who is executing the command has the required level of administration. If they do not, the script returns an error message.

The next line of code parses the parameters of the command to get the username of the player to be whitelisted.

The next few lines of code insert a new row into the whitelist table in the MySQL database, with the username and password of the player to be whitelisted.

The next line of code sets the pWhitelisted flag for the player who executed the command to 1, to indicate that they are now whitelisted.

The next line of code sends a system message to all players, indicating that the player has been whitelisted.

The next line of code logs the event to the log_admin file.

The final line of code prints a debug message to the console.
