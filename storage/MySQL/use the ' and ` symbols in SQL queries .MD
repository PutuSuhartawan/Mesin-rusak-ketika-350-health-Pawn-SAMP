The INSERT INTO statement in the query you provided does not use the " symbol because it is not necessary. The ' symbol is used to quote strings literally, and the username and pw columns in the whitelist table do not contain any special characters. Therefore, there is no need to use the " symbol to quote the strings.

The " symbol is only necessary when you need to quote strings that contain special characters. For example, if the username column contained the string john'doe, you would need to quote the string as "john'doe" in order to prevent the SQL engine from interpreting the apostrophe as a special character.

In general, you should only use the " symbol when you need to quote strings that contain special characters. If you are not sure whether or not a string contains special characters, it is always safe to quote the string with the ' symbol.







 Pawn script that you requested:
<code>
Code snippet
CMD:whitelist(playerid, params[])
{


	new username[MAX_PLAYER_NAME];

	if(PlayerInfo[playerid][pAdmin] < 4)
	{
	    return SCM(playerid, COLOR_SYNTAX, "[SYSTEM]: "RED" Anda Tidak Diizinkan Menggunakan Perintah.");
	}
	if(sscanf(params, "s[24]", username))
	{
	    return SCM(playerid, COLOR_SYNTAX, "[USAGE]: /whitelist [username]");
	}

   	mysql_format(connectionID, queryBuffer, sizeof(queryBuffer), "INSERT INTO `whitelist` (`username`) VALUES ('%s')", username);
   	mysql_tquery(connectionID, queryBuffer);
    PlayerInfo[playerid][pWhitelisted]=1;
    SAM(COLOR_YELLOW, "[SYSTEM]: "WHITE"  %s has whitelist %s's account.", GetRPName(playerid), username);
    Log_Write("log_admin", "%s (uid: %i) whitelist %s's account.", GetPlayerNameEx(playerid), PlayerInfo[playerid][pID], username);
    printf("[cmd] %s: [%s]", GetRPName(playerid), queryBuffer);


}

The main difference between this script and the one you provided is that this script does not include the pw column in the INSERT INTO statement. This is because the pw column is not required for whitelisting a player.

The other difference is that this script uses the mysql_format function to format the query string. The mysql_format function is a more secure way to format query strings, as it prevents SQL injection attacks.







the ways to use the ' and " symbols in SQL queries:

To quote strings literally: Use the ' symbol to quote strings literally. This means that any characters inside the quotes will be interpreted literally, and not as special characters. For example, the query SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'johndoe' will select all rows from the users table where the username column is equal to the string johndoe.
To quote strings that contain special characters: Use the " symbol to quote strings that contain special characters. This means that any characters that have special meaning in SQL, such as ", ', %, and _, can be escaped by preceding them with a ". For example, the query SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = "john'doe" will select all rows from the users table where the username column is equal to the string john'doe.
To quote identifiers: Use the symbol to quote identifiers. Identifiers are the names of tables, columns, and other objects in a database. The symbol is used to prevent the SQL engine from interpreting the identifier as a special character. For example, the whitelist string is a reserved word in MySQL, so it must be surrounded by backticks in order to be used as the name of a table.
Here is a table that summarizes the different ways to use the ' and " symbols in SQL queries:

'	Quotes strings literally
"	Quotes strings that contain special characters
``	Quotes identifiers








The ' and ` symbols are both used to quote strings in SQL queries, but they have different meanings. The ' symbol is used to quote strings literally, while the " symbol is used to quote strings that contain special characters.

' quotes strings literally. This means that any characters inside the quotes will be interpreted literally, and not as special characters. For example, the query SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'johndoe' will select all rows from the users table where the username column is equal to the string johndoe.
" quotes strings that contain special characters. This means that any characters that have special meaning in SQL, such as ", ', %, and _, can be escaped by preceding them with a ".
