table in a MySQL database that could be used to store anticheat data:

sql
Copy code
CREATE TABLE `anticheat_logs` (
  `id` int(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  `player_id` int(11) NOT NULL,
  `player_name` varchar(50) NOT NULL,
  `log_type` varchar(50) NOT NULL,
  `log_description` varchar(255) NOT NULL,
  `log_timestamp` timestamp NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  PRIMARY KEY (`id`)
) ENGINE=InnoDB AUTO_INCREMENT=1 DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8mb4;
This table includes the following fields:

id: the unique identifier for each log entry, set to auto-increment for convenience
player_id: the ID of the player who triggered the anticheat event
player_name: the name of the player who triggered the anticheat event
log_type: a string describing the type of anticheat event that was triggered (e.g. "speed hack", "aimbot", etc.)
log_description: a more detailed description of the anticheat event, including any relevant information that was logged (e.g. player speed, aimbot accuracy, etc.)
log_timestamp: the date and time that the anticheat event was logged
You could add or modify fields as needed for your specific anticheat system.
