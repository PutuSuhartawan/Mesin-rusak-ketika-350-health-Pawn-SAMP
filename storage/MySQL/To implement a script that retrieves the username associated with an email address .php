To implement a script that retrieves the username associated with an email address, you can follow these general steps:

Connect to your MySQL database using a suitable library for your scripting language.
Retrieve the username associated with the email address using a SELECT statement in your SQL query.
Display the username in the output.
Here's some sample code in PHP:

php
Copy code
<?php

// connect to MySQL database
$servername = "localhost";
$username = "yourusername";
$password = "yourpassword";
$dbname = "yourdatabase";

$conn = mysqli_connect($servername, $username, $password, $dbname);

// check connection
if (!$conn) {
  die("Connection failed: " . mysqli_connect_error());
}

// retrieve username from database based on email input
$email = $_POST["email"]; // assume email input is received via POST request

$sql = "SELECT username FROM users WHERE email='$email'";
$result = mysqli_query($conn, $sql);

// check if query returns any results
if (mysqli_num_rows($result) > 0) {
  // output username
  $row = mysqli_fetch_assoc($result);
  echo "Username: " . $row["username"];
} else {
  echo "No username found for email: " . $email;
}

// close database connection
mysqli_close($conn);

?>
Note that this is just an example and you may need to modify it to fit your specific use case. Also, make sure to sanitize and validate user inputs to prevent SQL injection and other security vulnerabilities.
