The cache_num_rows() function in Pawn script is used to get the number of rows in a cache. The cache is a temporary storage area that is used to store the results of a MySQL query. The cache_num_rows() function returns an integer that represents the number of rows in the cache.

The cache_num_rows() function is typically used in conjunction with the cache_get_value_index() function. The cache_get_value_index() function is used to get the value of a specific column from a row in the cache. The cache_num_rows() function can be used to determine the number of rows in the cache, and then the cache_get_value_index() function can be used to get the value of a specific column from a specific row in the cache.

For example, the following code gets the number of rows in the cache and then gets the value of the username column from the first row in the cache:

Code snippet
<code>
new rows;

rows = cache_num_rows();

if (rows > 0) {
  new username[MAX_PLAYER_NAME];
  cache_get_value_index(0, "username", username, sizeof(username));
  printf("The username is: %s\n", username);
}
</code>
