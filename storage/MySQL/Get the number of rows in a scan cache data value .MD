Q&A about using cache_num_rows():

Q: What is cache_num_rows()?

A: cache_num_rows() is a function in the Pawn programming language that is used to get the number of rows in a cache.

Q: What does cache_num_rows() return?

A: cache_num_rows() returns an integer that represents the number of rows in the cache.

Q: How do I use cache_num_rows()?

A: To use cache_num_rows(), you will need to first declare a variable to store the return value. For example, the following code declares a variable named rows to store the return value of cache_num_rows():

Code snippet
new rows;

Then, you can call the cache_num_rows() function and store the return value in the rows variable. For example, the following code calls the cache_num_rows() function and stores the return value in the rows variable:

Code snippet
rows = cache_num_rows();
Use code with caution. Learn more
Finally, you can use the rows variable to determine the number of rows in the cache. For example, the following code determines the number of rows in the cache and then prints the number of rows to the console:

Code snippet<code>
if (rows > 0) {
  printf("There are %d rows in the cache.\n", rows);
}</code>

Q: What are the limitations of using cache_num_rows()?

A: cache_num_rows() is a useful function for working with caches in Pawn scripts. However, there are a few limitations to be aware of:

cache_num_rows() only returns the number of rows in the cache. It does not return any information about the individual rows in the cache.
cache_num_rows() can only be used with caches that were created using the cache_create() function.
Q: What are some examples of using cache_num_rows()?

A: cache_num_rows() can be used in a variety of ways. For example, it can be used to:

Determine the number of rows in a cache before you start iterating through the cache.
Check if a cache is empty.
Determine the number of rows in a cache that match a specific criteria.





 a quadrant about using cache_num_rows():

When to use cache_num_rows()

When	Why
Before iterating through a cache	To determine how many rows there are in the cache so that you can allocate the appropriate amount of memory.
To check if a cache is empty	To determine if there are any rows in the cache.
To determine the number of rows in a cache that match a specific criteria	To filter the rows in the cache based on a specific criteria.
When not to use cache_num_rows()

When	Why
To get the value of a specific column from a row in the cache	Use the cache_get_value_index() function instead.
To get the number of rows in a cache that have been updated since a specific time	Use the cache_get_updated_rows() function instead.
To get the number of rows in a cache that have been deleted since a specific time	Use the cache_get_deleted_rows() function instead.







The cache_num_rows() function in Pawn script is used to get the number of rows in a cache. The cache is a temporary storage area that is used to store the results of a MySQL query. The cache_num_rows() function returns an integer that represents the number of rows in the cache.

The cache_num_rows() function is typically used in conjunction with the cache_get_value_index() function. The cache_get_value_index() function is used to get the value of a specific column from a row in the cache. The cache_num_rows() function can be used to determine the number of rows in the cache, and then the cache_get_value_index() function can be used to get the value of a specific column from a specific row in the cache.

For example, the following code gets the number of rows in the cache and then gets the value of the username column from the first row in the cache:

Code snippet
<code>
new rows;

rows = cache_num_rows();

if (rows > 0) {
  new username[MAX_PLAYER_NAME];
  cache_get_value_index(0, "username", username, sizeof(username));
  printf("The username is: %s\n", username);
}
</code>

The cache_num_rows() function is a useful tool for working with caches in Pawn scripts. It can be used to determine the number of rows in a cache, and then it can be used to get the value of a specific column from a specific row in the cache.
