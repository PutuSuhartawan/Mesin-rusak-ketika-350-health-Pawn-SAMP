The mysql_format() function in Pawn is used to format a string that will be used as a SQL query. The first parameter is the connection handle, the second parameter is the buffer where the formatted string will be stored, the third parameter is the size of the buffer, and the fourth parameter is the SQL query itself. The %d placeholder in the SQL query is replaced with the value of the pID variable.

The reason why we need to use SQL in Pawn scripts is because Pawn does not have native support for databases. By using SQL, we can interact with databases and store data in a persistent way.

In the specific example you provided, the mysql_format() function is used to format a SQL query that will update the firstspawn field in the users table to 0 for the user with the ID pID.

Here is a breakdown of the SQL query:

UPDATE users - This tells the database to update the users table.
SET firstspawn = 0 - This sets the firstspawn field to 0.
WHERE uid = %d - This specifies that the update should only be applied to the user with the ID pID.
The %d placeholder is replaced with the value of the pID variable when the mysql_format() function is called. This ensures that the SQL query is only applied to the correct user.




mysql_format(connectionID, queryBuffer, sizeof(queryBuffer), "UPDATE users SET firstspawn = 0 WHERE uid = %d", PlayerInfo[playerid][pID]);
	mysql_tquery(connectionID, queryBuffer);
		// first time to spawn for whitelisted
		PlayerInfo[playerid][pWhitelistLocked]=0;
