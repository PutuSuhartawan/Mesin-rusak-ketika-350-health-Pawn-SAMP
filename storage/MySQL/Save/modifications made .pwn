/*
The code you provided is a function called SaveVehicleModifications() that saves the modifications made to a vehicle to the database. The function takes one parameter: vehicleid, which is the ID of the vehicle.

The function first loops through the 14 slots in the vehicle's modification array. For each slot, the function gets the component that is currently in the slot using the GetVehicleComponentInSlot() function.

Next, the function formats a MySQL query that updates the database with the new modification for the slot. The query uses the i + 1 because the slots in the modification array are numbered from 0 to 13, but the MySQL database uses slots from 1 to 14.

Finally, the function executes the MySQL query.

Here is a breakdown of the code:

SaveVehicleModifications(vehicleid)
{
for(new i = 0; i < 14; i ++)
{
VehicleInfo[vehicleid][vMods][i] = GetVehicleComponentInSlot(vehicleid, i);

Code snippet
    mysql_format(connectionID, queryBuffer, sizeof(queryBuffer), "UPDATE vehicles SET mod_%i = %i WHERE id = %i", i + 1, VehicleInfo[vehicleid][vMods][i], VehicleInfo[vehicleid][vID]);
    mysql_tquery(connectionID, queryBuffer);
}

}

The first line of code declares the SaveVehicleModifications() function. The function takes one parameter: vehicleid, which is the ID of the vehicle.
The second line of code starts a loop that iterates from 0 to 13.
The third line of code gets the component that is currently in the slot using the GetVehicleComponentInSlot() function.
The fourth line of code formats the MySQL query that updates the database with the new modification for the slot.
The fifth line of code executes the MySQL query.
