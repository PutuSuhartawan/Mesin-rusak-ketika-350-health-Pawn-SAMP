function that updates a MySQL database when an auction winner has paid the bill price for an item, and changes the owner of the electronic shop:

Copy code
// Function to update MySQL data when auction winner pays bill price
public OnAuctionPaymentReceived(auction_id, winner_id, bill_price)
{
    // Update the auction status to "paid" in the MySQL database
    mysql_query("UPDATE auctions SET status='paid' WHERE id=%d", auction_id);
    
    // Get the ID of the electronic shop owner
    new shop_owner_id = GetElectronicShopOwnerID();
    
    // Transfer the ownership of the item to the auction winner
    TransferOwnership(auction_id, winner_id);
    
    // Update the owner of the electronic shop in the MySQL database
    mysql_query("UPDATE electronic_shops SET owner_id=%d WHERE owner_id=%d", winner_id, shop_owner_id);
    
    return 1;
}
This function takes three parameters: auction_id, which is the ID of the auction; winner_id, which is the ID of the auction winner who paid the bill price; and bill_price, which is the amount paid by the auction winner.

The function updates the auctions table in the MySQL database to set the status column to "paid" for the auction with the specified auction_id. It then uses a custom function GetElectronicShopOwnerID to get the ID of the current owner of the electronic shop. The TransferOwnership function is called to transfer ownership of the item to the auction winner. Finally, the electronic_shops table in the MySQL database is updated to set the owner_id column to the ID of the auction winner, replacing the previous owner ID obtained from GetElectronicShopOwnerID.

Note that this example function assumes that you have already defined the necessary MySQL functions for connecting to the database and executing queries, as well as the TransferOwnership function to transfer ownership of an item in your game's system. You would need to modify the queries and other function calls to match your specific implementation.
