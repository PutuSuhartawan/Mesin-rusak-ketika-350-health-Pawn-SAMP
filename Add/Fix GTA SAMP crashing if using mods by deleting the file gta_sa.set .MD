Sure, here are the steps on how to fix GTA SAMP crashing if using mods by deleting the file gta_sa.set:

1. Close GTA SAMP and any other GTA-related programs.
2. Go to the following folder:

```
C:\Users\[Your Username]\Documents\GTA San Andreas User Files
```

3. Delete the file gta_sa.set.
4. Launch GTA SAMP.

If this does not fix the problem, then you may need to try one of the other steps mentioned above.

Here are some additional things to keep in mind:

* Deleting the gta_sa.set file will reset all of your GTA SAMP settings, so you may need to re-configure your settings after you delete the file.
* If you have any mods installed, you may need to reinstall them after you delete the gta_sa.set file.
* If you are still having problems after deleting the gta_sa.set file, then you may need to contact Rockstar Games support for further assistance.
