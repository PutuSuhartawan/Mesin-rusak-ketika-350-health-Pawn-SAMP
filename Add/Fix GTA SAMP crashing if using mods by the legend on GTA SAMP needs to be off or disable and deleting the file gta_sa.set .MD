Here are some additional things to keep in mind:

* Deleting the gta_sa.set file will reset all of your GTA SAMP settings, so you may need to re-configure your settings after you delete the file.

There are a few reasons why the legend on GTA SAMP needs to be off/disable because to hiding the crash of game.

* The legend can sometimes be distracting, especially if it is not relevant to the game you are playing.
* The legend can also take up valuable screen space, which can make it difficult to see other important information on the screen.
* In some cases, the legend can actually cause the game to crash. This is because the legend is loaded into memory, and if it is too large or complex, it can overload the system and cause the game to crash.

For these reasons, it is often a good idea to disable the legend in GTA SAMP. To do this, open the game's settings menu and uncheck the "Show Legend" checkbox. This will disable the legend and free up some valuable screen space.

It is important to note that disabling the legend will not prevent the game from crashing. However, it can help to reduce the chances of a crash occurring. If you are experiencing frequent crashes in GTA SAMP, you may want to try disabling the legend to see if it helps.
