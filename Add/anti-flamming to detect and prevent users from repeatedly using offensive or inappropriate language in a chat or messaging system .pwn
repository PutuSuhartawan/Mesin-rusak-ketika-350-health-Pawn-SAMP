An anti-flamming script is designed to detect and prevent users from repeatedly using offensive or inappropriate language in a chat or messaging system. The script can be implemented in various programming languages, including Pawn, C++, Java, and more.



Here is an example of an anti-flamming script in Pawn:

```
// Anti-Flamming script

new MAX_FLAMMING_LEVEL = 5;
new gFlammingLevel[MAX_PLAYERS];

public OnPlayerText(playerid, text[])
{
    if(gFlammingLevel[playerid] >= MAX_FLAMMING_LEVEL)
    {
        SendClientMessage(playerid, COLOR_RED, "You have reached the maximum level of flamming. Please refrain from using offensive language.");
        return 0;
    }

    // Check for offensive language
    if(contains_offensive_language(text))
    {
        gFlammingLevel[playerid]++;
        SendClientMessage(playerid, COLOR_RED, "Your message contains offensive language. Flamming level increased.");
        return 0;
    }

    // Clear flamming level if message is not offensive
    gFlammingLevel[playerid] = 0;

    // Message is safe to send
    return 1;
}

// Function to check for offensive language
public contains_offensive_language(text[])
{
    new bad_words[] = {"bad", "offensive", "inappropriate", "swear", "curse", "hate"};
    new word_count = sizeof(bad_words);

    for(new i = 0; i < word_count; i++)
    {
        if(strfind(text, bad_words[i]) != -1)
        {
            return true;
        }
    }

    return false;
}
```

This script tracks the flamming level of each player and restricts them from sending messages if they repeatedly use offensive language. It uses a list of bad words to detect if a message contains offensive language. If a message contains a bad word, the flamming level of the player is increased, and they are informed of their current level. Once a
