An anti-punch system for hospital interiors could be implemented in a few different ways, but here is one possible approach using Pawn scripting:

1. Create a variable to store the last time the player punched (or attempted to punch) someone:
```
new LastPunchTime[MAX_PLAYERS];
```

2. In the `OnPlayerInteriorChange` callback, check if the player has entered a hospital interior:
```
public OnPlayerInteriorChange(playerid, newinteriorid, oldinteriorid)
{
    if (newinteriorid == HOSPITAL_INTERIOR_ID)
    {
        // Player has entered a hospital interior, reset their last punch time
        LastPunchTime[playerid] = 0;
    }
}
```

3. In the `OnPlayerUpdate` callback, check if the player is in the hospital interior and has pressed the punch key:
```
public OnPlayerUpdate(playerid)
{
    if (GetPlayerInterior(playerid) == HOSPITAL_INTERIOR_ID && IsPlayerKeyPressed(playerid, KEY_FIRE))
    {
        // Player is in hospital and has punched, check if they are within the reception area
        if (IsPlayerInRangeOfPoint(playerid, RECEPTION_X, RECEPTION_Y, RECEPTION_Z, RECEPTION_RANGE))
        {
            // Player is within reception area, check if enough time has passed since last punch
            if (gettime() - LastPunchTime[playerid] < PUNCH_DELAY_MS)
            {
                // Player has punched too soon, cancel the punch and send a warning message
                CancelPlayerAnimation(playerid);
                SendClientMessage(playerid, COLOR_RED, "Please wait a moment before punching again.");
            }
            else
            {
                // Player has not punched recently, update their last punch time
                LastPunchTime[playerid] = gettime();
            }
        }
    }
}
```

4. Adjust the constants `HOSPITAL_INTERIOR_ID`, `RECEPTION_X/Y/Z`, `RECEPTION_RANGE`, and `PUNCH_DELAY_MS` to suit your server's configuration and preferences.

This system should prevent players from repeatedly punching in the hospital reception area, without interfering with their ability to defend themselves elsewhere.
