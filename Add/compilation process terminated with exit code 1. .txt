The error message you provided suggests that the compilation process terminated with exit code 1. This error is usually caused by syntax errors or other issues in the code that prevent it from compiling successfully.

To fix this error, you can try the following steps:

Check your code for syntax errors or other issues that might prevent it from compiling successfully. Use a code editor with syntax highlighting and error highlighting to help you identify any issues in your code.

Check the compilation settings in your tasks.json file to make sure they are correct. Make sure that the compiler you are using is compatible with your code and that the compilation settings are set up correctly.

Make sure that any dependencies required by your code are installed and configured correctly. This may include libraries, plugins, or other components that your code depends on to compile and run.

Check the documentation for the compiler you are using to see if there are any known issues or workarounds for this error. You may also want to search online forums or developer communities to see if other developers have encountered similar issues and have found solutions.

If you are still unable to resolve the issue, consider seeking help from a more experienced developer or consulting the documentation for your code editor or compiler for additional guidance.
